Non-trivial formulae for Demanding Children problem:
1. In every state reachable by not asking a question, it is possible that the child never will have a question

nu X. (([i]X && ([others]X && ([wisdom]X && [playing]X ))) && nu Y. ((<i>Y || (<others>Y || (<wisdom>Y || <playing>Y )))))


2. Invariantly, the child can ask a question in some future

nu X. (([i]X && ([ask]X && ([wisdom]X && [playing]X ))) && mu Y. (((<i>Y || <wisdom>Y) || <playing>Y) || <ask>true ))


3. There is a course of events in which only the same child infinitely often loops the ask-wisdom-playing cycle

nu X. mu Y. ( (((<ask>X || <wisdom>X) || <playing>X) || <i>Y) || <others>Y)


4. In every state reachable by asking a question, the child will eventually get an answer and return to playing mode

nu X. ([ask]X && mu Y. (<wisdom>true || (<playing>true || <i>Y )) )
